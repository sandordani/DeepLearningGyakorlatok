    "A key use case of Natural Language Processing (NLP) - often regarded as the 'Holy Grail' of the field - is the ability to have a machine automatically translate text from one language to another.  This field is known as Machine Translation (MT) and when using Neural Networks and Deep Learning, it is usually called Neural Machine Translation (NMT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation between languages is often difficult, even for a human.  Languages differ from each other in many ways, some more subtle than others.  An entire field of study - [Linguistic Typology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology) - is dedicated to the understanding of how languages compare to each other.  As such, translation requires excellent knowledge of both source and target languages and their vagaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the huge amounts of textual data available today, coupled with the compute power afforded by GPUs, it is only natural that NMT will see a huge rise in usage.  In fact, a number of well-known companies offer various products in this area.\n",

    "# Machine Translation - Some Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation belongs to a class of problems known as *Sequence-to-Sequence*. As the name implies, these problems deal with converting a *source sequence* $X$ into a *target sequence* $Y$.  Framing machine translation as a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq-to-Seq) problem suggests that $X$ contains tokens (words or individual characters) in a source *language* while $Y$ are the equivalent tokens in the *target* language. Note that in the most general case, $X$ and $Y$ may have different lengths and equivalent tokens may even be in different locations, depending on the underlying word order of the languages involved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of NMT, we would like to learn a function $f$ that maximizes the probability of a target sequence $Y$ given the source sequence $X$.  More formally:  given $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$ and $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_m\\}$ we would like $f$ to maximize the following conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y_i \\space | \\space y_{i-1}, ..., y_{1}, X) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for every $y_i$ in $Y$. There are two important points about this expression:\n",
    "1.  We take into account information from the source sequence X.  In fact, we will use a function $g(X)$ which will *encode* X into some useful form.  \n",
    "2.  The value of the current output token $y_i$ depends on all previous output tokens.  This is where the 'sequence' nature of the problem comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a deep neural network to learn this function $f$."

Take Translation D for example: double use of 'ever' in one sentence probably lowers its score as a good English translation. Interestingly, the models producing the better translations all share an architectural detail. This is a key observation, and one that we will return to later when we discuss the *attention mechanism*.\n",

    "An often-used architecture for seq-to-seq models - and hence, NMT - is known as `encoder-decoder`.  At a high level, the following steps are carried out by this network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Input - in our case, a human-readable date - is fed into the `encoder` part of the network.  The output of the encoder is one or many *state* vectors (also known as *context* vectors).  These state vectors encode a *representation* of the input data.  Each individual timestep may have its own context vector.  Alternatively, we can use the final state vector to represent the entire input.  Using the notation from the background section above:  given a sequence $X = \\{h_1, h_2, ..., h_j\\}$ - where $h_j$ is the output of the encoder DNN -  we can choose $g(X)$ to return all values in $X$ or simply choose $g(X) = h_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The output of the encoder is fed into the *decoder* part of the network.  In other words, the decoder receives the *representations* of the input that were learned by the encoder. The output of the decoder is the final output which in our case is the machine-readable date.  The decoder uses the data encoded in the state vectors to create the output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since both the inputs and outputs of our model are sequences, it makes sense to use RNN's as the basis of both the encoder and decoder.  We can then train the encoder-decoder model in an end-to-end fashion so that both networks learn the relevant features.\n",

    "As shown in the figure, the input to the encoder is the text of the human-readable date.  Each character in the sequence is then run through an *embedding layer*.  The purpose of the embedding is to convert a sparse, 1-hot representation of the character to a dense representation which learns features about this character.  This representation is then fed into a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM).  The purpose of the Bi-LSTM is to look at a particular sequences both from front-to-back as well as from back-to-front.  In this way, the network creates a context for each character in the text that depends on both its past as well as its future.  Finally, we take the sequence of hidden states of the Bi-LSTM as our state vector list `enc_out`.\n",

    "We see that there is a fair bit of correlation, but the two factors are not identical.  We can therefore conclude that the model does best on 'easy' cases where it knows precisely where every part of the human-readable date is.  If we add in some form of 'noise' - for example, moving the day or year, using a full month name or adding superfluous components such as week day names - the model gets 'confused'.  Ideally, we would like a mechanism whereby the model can *focus* or *concentrate*.  In other words - the model will recognize the day, month and year no matter where they appear in the input and ignore parts of the input that do not affect the results.\n",

    "In order to explain the concept of attention, we'll try a little exercise.  Look around you and pick some object like a light switch or a chair.  Look at the object for a few seconds and focus on it completely.  Notice how this object stays sharp in your field of view, while other objects seem to just fade into the background.  Also, note that this fading is gradual - things that are closer to your object are sharper while things further away are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, in a nutshell, is attention - the ability to concentrate on what's relevant and ignore that which is irrelevant for the task at hand.  In Deep Learning, attention is a technique which is used to help the model focus - at every timestep - on only the relevant inputs.  For our purposes, it is the ability to focus on specific tokens while ignoring the rest.  To be more precise, we'll be using *soft-attention* - that is, we will not ignore tokens completely but rather assign them *weights* that determine how much the model should focus on them at any moment in time.\n",

Adding an attention block between the encoder and decoder does just that.\n",

    "In the above figure we can see the details of the attention block.  Each hidden state $h_i$ is composed of the combined output of the forwards and backwards LSTM (i.e., a Bi-LSTM). Furthermore, each such state has an associated weight at each timestep (the $\\alpha_t$ values). This weighted sum of the states, along with the hidden state of the decoder network at time $t-1$, along with the output of the decoder at $t-1$, are used to calculate the output of the decoder at time $t$.  $\\alpha_t$'s are calculated using an *alignment model*, which learns which encoder state ($h_j$) is relevant at what point in the decoder.\n",

    "As discussed above, we use a character-by-character comparison to measure the date translation problem's accuracy.  For this problem, such a measure of success is sensible, as there is only one possible output 'translation'.  When dealing with real-world machine translation tasks, however, measuring results in this way is not a good idea.  To illustrate why, let's consider a slight modification on our date translation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem statement, we wish to translate from a human-readable format to a *specific* machine readable format, namely YYYY-MM-dd.  Similarly, we could have used a different format, such as dd-MM-YYYY.  So for a date such as 'January 12, 1984' we could have several translations.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1984-01-12 (YYYY-MM-dd)\n",
    "* 12-01-1984 (dd-MM-YYYY)\n",
    "* 1984-12-01 (YYYY-dd-MM)\n",
    "\n",
    "or any other such variant.  Unless stated explicitly, all machine-readable formats can be considered to be equally good translations.  Naturally, this applies even more strongly to human language: different people may translate the same source-language sentence to multiple variants in the target language.  Can we distinctly say which one is 'better' or 'worse'?  For example, here are some English translations of a Chinese sentence (taken from the original BLEU paper - see below):\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a guide to action that ensures that the military will forever heed Party commands.\n",
    "* It is the guiding principle which guarantees the military forces always being under the command of the Party.\n",
    "* It is the practical guide for the army always to heed the directions of the party.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that a better metric is needed for measuring machine translation results than just plain 'is this character in the right spot'.  This metric is known as the [Bilingual Evaluation Understudy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), or BLEU, score.  We will implement BLEU below.  For now, let's get some intuition on the BLEU scores for our toy problem.  In the process, we'll also get to see some more features of Open Seq2Seq.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exercise__:  Open the file `dates_eval_config.py` and complete the missing pieces in the `eval_params` section.  Use the *test* versions of the source and target files. Run the following cells to re-train the model and observe the BLEU scores during training.  A completed file is available in `dates_eval_config.py.solution`."

    "BPE stands for byte pair encoding. It means that common byte pairs - bigrams of characters in our case - are replaced by a byte which never occurs in the corpus. For example, in our corpus we have never seen the \"#\" char so we could use it to represent some typical bigram like \"ie\". In practice, however, all the printable characters are used, so we use the unprintable part of the codepage for BPE.  In order actually print the text, we need to reformat it back. So you'll see \"@@\" in text - these are artifacts from such renormalization.\n",

There are various formulas applied to sentence, corpus or any length translation, but it's meant to be a good proxy to compare various implementations. Our date translation examples are simple, but BLEU score is also meant to encapsulate how a human would rate the translation for language translations.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will split each ground truth to one character at a time and also the predicted value. BLEU score works on the 1-4 ngrams so we need to supply at least 4 ngrams in our predictions. If we had a string 2007-07-11, we can split it into tokens 2007, 07 and 11. For exact matches, the score is 1.0 but for small variations like one character off, it makes the score lower than it should be. We will call this string score implemented in `str_score`.\n",

    "Alternatively, we can convert it to list of ['2', '0', '0', '7', '-', '0', '7', '-', '1', '1'] by making a token of every single character, including dashes to get the higher score. It should be implemented in `char_score`. Let's compare the two implementations and the BLEU scores they calculate.\n",

    "# [Optional] Experiment with Beam Search\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, attention changes the probability of which character to focus on in a given sequence. There are other strategies we can apply to improve the results of the translation. Beam search is one such popular heuristic. It works by returning a list of output *sequences* that are most likely for a given input. It does this by exploring all of the possible next steps, and then chooses the most promising $k$ candidates from all possibilities. Those candidates form a 'beam' of directions, where the algorithm expands the search through each candidate's sequence of probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the beam, the better the performance of the model. Since there are more candidate sequences this means the likelihood of finding the right answer increases. However, it requires more decoding, meaning a direct tradeoff with the quality of results versus accuracy. Seeding beam search with the most likely next words in a sequence can yield good results. The beam search would generate the resulting sequence, starting from the first word and appending, while exploring all the candidates (size of the beam) every step of the way.\n",
